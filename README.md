These are some of my timed Human Nature notes.  They include ideas and reports of my discoveries that will produce Zulfikar Moinuddin Ahmed's Paradigm for natural science for Virtue-Eudaimonia that differs in precise formulation from all earlier thought about Virtues and their relationship to Life Satisfaction.  These are true about nature, and eventually will transform the world's perspective on these issues.
